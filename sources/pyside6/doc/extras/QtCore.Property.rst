.. currentmodule:: PySide6.QtCore
.. py:class:: Property

    Detailed Description
    --------------------

    The Property function lets you declare properties that
    behave both as Qt and Python properties, and have their
    getters and setters defined as Python functions.

    They are equivalent to the ``Q_PROPERTY`` macro in the `Qt Docs`_.

    Here is an example that illustrates how to use this
    function:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

        from PySide6.QtCore import QObject, Property

        class MyObject(QObject):
            def __init__(self, startval=42):
                QObject.__init__(self)
                self.ppval = startval

            def readPP(self):
                return self.ppval

            def setPP(self, val):
                self.ppval = val

            pp = Property(int, readPP, setPP)

        obj = MyObject()
        obj.pp = 47
        print(obj.pp)

    The full options for ``QtCore.Property`` can be found with ``QtCore.Property.__doc__``:

    .. code-block:: python

        Property(self, type: type,
                 fget: Optional[Callable] = None,
                 fset: Optional[Callable] = None,
                 freset: Optional[Callable] = None,
                 fdel: Optional[Callable] = None,
                 doc: str = '',
                 notify: Optional[Callable] = None,
                 designable: bool = True,
                 scriptable: bool = True,
                 stored: bool = True, user: bool = False,
                 constant: bool = False,
                 final: bool = False) -> PySide6.QtCore.Property

    Normally, only ``type``, ``fget``and ``fset`` are used.


    Properties compared with Python properties
    ------------------------------------------

    ``Python`` has property objects very similar to ``QtCore.Property``.
    Despite the fact that the latter has an extra ``freset`` function, the usage
    of properties is almost the same. The main difference is that ``QtCore.Property``
    requires a ``type`` parameter.


    .. note:: ``Python`` property objects do *not* work in QML; ``QtCore.Property``
              needs to be used.

    In the above example, the following lines would be equivalent properties:

    .. code-block:: python

        pp = QtCore.Property(int, readPP, setPP)    # PySide version
        pp = property(readPP, setPP)                # Python version

    As you know from the `Python Docs`_, ``Python`` allows to break the property
    creation into multiple steps, using the decorator syntax. We can do this in
    ``PySide`` as well:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

        from PySide6.QtCore import QObject, Property

        class MyObject(QObject):
            def __init__(self, startval=42):
                QObject.__init__(self)
                self.ppval = startval

            @Property(int)
            def pp(self):
                return self.ppval

            @pp.setter
            def pp(self, val):
                self.ppval = val

        obj = MyObject()
        obj.pp = 47
        print(obj.pp)

    Please be careful here: The two ``Python`` functions have the same name, intentionally.
    This is needed to let ``Python`` know that these functions belong to the same property.


    Properties in QML expressions
    -----------------------------

    If you are using properties of your objects in QML expressions,
    QML requires that the property changes are notified. Here is an
    example illustrating how to do this:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

        from PySide6.QtCore import QObject, Signal, Property

        class Person(QObject):

            name_changed = Signal()

            def __init__(self, name):
                QObject.__init__(self)
                self._person_name = name

            def _name(self):
                return self._person_name

            name = Property(str, _name, notify=name_changed)
