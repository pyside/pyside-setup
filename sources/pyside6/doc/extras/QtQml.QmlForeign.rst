.. currentmodule:: PySide6.QtQml
.. py:decorator:: QmlForeign

    This decorator can be used to change the type that is created by QML.

    This is useful for registering types that cannot be amended by adding the
    :deco:`QmlElement` decorator, for example because they belong to 3rdparty libraries.

    .. code-block:: python

        QML_IMPORT_NAME = "com.library.name"
        QML_IMPORT_MAJOR_VERSION = 1
        QML_IMPORT_MINOR_VERSION = 0 # Optional

        @QmlNamedElement("QWidget")
        @QmlForeign(QWidget)
        class ForeignWidgetHelperClass(QObject):
              ...

    Afterwards the class may be used in QML:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        import com.library.name 1.0

        QWidget {
            // ...
        }
